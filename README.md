================

The port version of [Bukkit Essentials](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/essentials/) for [PocketMine-MP Software](http://http://www.pocketmine.net/).

**Remember that we will only support PocketMine-MP [Beta Builds](https://github.com/PocketMine/PocketMine-MP/releases) now.**

If you are planning to use PocketMine-MP _Dev_ builds keep in mind that EssentialsPE can crash it because may not support _Dev_ API versions.
